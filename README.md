Magic: The Gathering Deck Lists:

These are casual decks, designed for 4-player 1v1v1v1 games, which have been play-tested during office lunchtimes.

Most decks are based upon well-documented mechanics, but should have some original cards and ideas within them. 

  - Land Warp : Fast Landfall deck that relies upon Realm Razer to bounce lands in for large numbers of token creatures
  - Demon Seed : Shadowborn Apostle demon-tutoring deck that generates zombie tokens and deals direct damage each time you sac the humans.
  - Theros Heroic B/W Block Constructed: Human heroic token generation. 
  - Theros Revel R/G/W Block Constructed: First attempt at constructing a red deck fro
  - Red Deck Wins : not in my experience. Work in progress.
  - Malice BR Rakdos : Aggro race to drop Sire of Insanity.
  - Blue Control : Blue/White control deck. No real mechanic. My first attempt at deckbuilding.
