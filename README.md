Magic: The Gathering Deck Lists:

These are casual decks, designed for 4-player 1v1v1v1 games, which have been play-tested during office lunchtimes.

Most decks are based upon well-documented mechanics, but should have some original cards and ideas within them. 

  - Land Warp : Fast Landfall deck that relies upon Realm Razer to bounce lands in for large numbers of token creatures
  - Theros Heroic B/W Block Constructed: Human heroic token generation.
